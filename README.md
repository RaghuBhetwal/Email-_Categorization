### The LSTM, BERT model, trained on pre-processed data and leveraging sequential modeling, achieved a high level of accuracy;
### Future work could involve further optimization of the model, exploring alternative algorithms to extract more relevant information with sentiment analysis, and evaluating the system on different datasets!
